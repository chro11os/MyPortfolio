        <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      In the mystical realm of academia, there exists a young mage named Neil Brags Guzman. At the mere age of 19, he embarks on a quest at Mapua University, delving deep into the arcane arts of Computer Science. With a heart set on becoming a cybersecurity expert and web developer, Neil dabbles in the ancient language known as "Holy C." His journey is not for the faint of heart, for he navigates the ethereal planes using Temple OS as his trusty steed. But even in his casual moments, Neil wields the mighty Linux kernel-hardened Qubes OS, a testament to his prowess. In the realms of programming languages, Neil is a master of five or more tongues, his skills akin to the ancient scrolls of lore. As he embarks on his adventure, his path is illuminated by the glow of his monitor, casting shadows of algorithms and code upon the digital landscape.
